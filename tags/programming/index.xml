      <description>Each process in the system uses certain amount of different resources like files, CPU time, memory and so on.
Such resources are not infinite and each process and we should have an instrument to manage it. Sometimes it is useful to know current limits for a certain resource or to change it&amp;rsquo;s value. In this post we will consider such instruments that allow us to get information about limits for a process and increase or decrease such limits.</description>
