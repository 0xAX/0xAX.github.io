      <description>Despite Haskell programming language is not young language, it has a really great and helpful community, it has big amount of libraries, unfortunately Haskell is not popular programming language. I&amp;rsquo;m not against this programming language, opposite, haskell&amp;rsquo;s unpopularity makes me sad. I will not write about haskell popularity in industry, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain my thoughts about &amp;ldquo;Why Haskell is not popular&amp;rdquo; not as Haskell expert, not as professional Haskell developer (i don&amp;rsquo;t get payment for Haskell programming), but from position of usual developer who started to learn/experiment with Haskell some months ago and already don&amp;rsquo;t afraid monads :).</description>

      <title>Get function execution time in Haskell</title>

      <description>Some times ago I encountered with question: How to get function execution time in Haskell program? I asked this question at StackOverflow, and got some useful answers. Here i will try to describe how to do it. For example we have simple haskell program which will calculate sum of prime numbers which are between 0 and 10000. Something like this:
module TimingTest where main :: IO() main = do putStrLn &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; putStrLn (&amp;quot;Result: &amp;quot; ++ show primesSum) putStrLn &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot; -- -- Returns True if `n` is prime -- isPrime :: Int -&amp;gt; Bool isPrime n = null [ x | x &amp;lt;- [2.</description>
