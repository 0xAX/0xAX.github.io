      <description>Despite Haskell programming language is not young language, it has a really great and helpful community, it has big amount of libraries, unfortunately Haskell is not popular programming language. I&amp;rsquo;m not against this programming language, opposite, haskell&amp;rsquo;s unpopularity makes me sad. I will not write about haskell popularity in industry, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to explain my thoughts about &amp;ldquo;Why Haskell is not popular&amp;rdquo; not as Haskell expert, not as professional Haskell developer (i don&amp;rsquo;t get payment for Haskell programming), but from position of usual developer who started to learn/experiment with Haskell some months ago and already don&amp;rsquo;t afraid monads :).</description>
