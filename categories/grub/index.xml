      <description>This blog post is closely related with my interest in low-level stuff. As you already may know, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to be interested in such things like: How N works, where the N is something like - what does occur when we turn on the computer, pressing key on keyboard, how does an operating system load a program and many many more. I have found answers on some of my questions.</description>
